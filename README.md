## Promises and Error Handling Challenge
- This project is a small TypeScript + Node.js lab that simulates calling multiple APIs using Promises. It includes fetching a product catalog, product reviews, and a sales report, with random failures to practice real-world async logic.

# Objectives
- Apply Promises to manage multiple asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- Implement chained Promises to handle sequential data retrieval and manage dependencies between API calls.
- Utilize .catch() and .finally() to handle errors and perform cleanup tasks in a Promise chain.
- Design custom error classes to improve error identification and debugging.
- Implement a retry mechanism to manage failed asynchronous requests, enhancing application resilience.
- Analyze the benefits and challenges of using error handling strategies in complex asynchronous workflows.
